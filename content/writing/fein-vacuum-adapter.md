Fusion360

BambuLab P1S

42mm 5.0mm Left hand thread
made custom threads by copying an existing thread definition and adding new values until I found one that matched the reference model (since the reference was not editable).

tested with random 12x1.75mm magnets stacked two high, decent holding, but a bit of shaking + weight of hose breaks the connection. ordered some n52 3/8" x 1/4" to test.

embedded magnets. bambu slicer pause at slice - neat!

orbital sander - started with the Fusion360 file provided at the link. Chopped off the top half, then replaced it with the magnetic connection base. Printed with the magnet side face down to facilitate pause for magnet. Had good luck with "tree supports" turned on, angle turned down to 20, and "base plate only" for the supports.


used for thread reference - ended up modeling from scratch
