We use [Librechat](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat) at work and it is a fantastic experience. I just followed the excellent documentation to set up my own personal copy hosted on DigitalOcean to enjoy the ChatGPT-like experience, but with my API key instead of the standard service. The instructions were great and easy to follow.
