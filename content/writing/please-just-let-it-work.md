I don't know if it's that I've been using computers and the internet for so long, or that I write software for a living, but when I ask a program to do something complex, I still find myself holding my breath and expecting it to fail. Even in 2024, my bar is so low that I am hopeful simply for things to work. This is not even expecting software to "just work" a la the magical, unreachable Apple standard of yore, but more like a "please don't lose my data" and "please just do the thing you said you could do and don't break".
