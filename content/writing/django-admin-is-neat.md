Today I prototyped a system using the Django Admin system for the first time and I was wowed by how quickly I could go from concept to functional system for verification of an idea. The graphical browsing and manipulation of database tables made from very little code (primarily database model definitions) made me happy. I plan to use this again. Django still feels heavy to me and fills my database up with things I don't think I want, but it sure comes with nice toys.
